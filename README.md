# Android App Development
# Task 1 Unit Converter Application:- 
This application will aim at helping its users by converting the units from one
another. This app will take input from the user and convert it to the desired
unit and give the result. For example, it will be able to convert a value in
centimeters to Meters or grams to kilograms and vice versa.

To develop this application, Android Studio is required. The knowledge of
XML would be required for the user interface and the Java programming for
the application’s conversion functionality.

# Task 2 To DO App:- 
This application as the name suggests will be a To-Do list holding app. It’ll
store the users schedules and their upcoming meetings or events. In this
application, users will be enabled to write their important notes as well. To
make it safe, provide a login page before the user can access it.


So, this app will have a login page, sign-up page, logout system, and the area
to write their tasks, events, or important notes. You can build it in android
studio using Java and XML at ease. Using XML you can build the user
interface as user-friendly as you can. And to store the users’ data, you can
use SQLite enabling the users to even delete the data permanently.


# Task 3 Calculator:- 
A calculator will be an easy application if you have just learned Android and
coding for Java. This Application will simply take the input values and the
operation to be performed from the users. After taking the input it’ll return
the results to them on the screen. This is a really easy application and doesn’t
need use of any particular package.


# Task 4 Quiz Application:-
Here you can provide the users with Quiz on various general knowledge
topics. These practices will ensure that you’re able to set the layouts properly
and slowly increase your pace of learning the Android application
development. In this you’ll learn to use various Layout components at the
same time understanding them better.


In the app, questions would be asked and answers would be shown as
multiple choices. The user selects the answer and gets shown on the screen
if the answers are correct. In the end the final marks would be shown to the
users.

# Task 5 Stop Watch:- 
A stopwatch is another simple android project idea that will work the same
as a normal handheld timepiece that measures the time elapsed between its
activation and deactivation. This application will have three buttons that are:
start, stop, and hold.
